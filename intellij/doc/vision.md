The reviewers need to verify that they have already been through the college application process by either through their active @collegename.edu and graduate students can verify through their old college transcript or any form of old college ID.
The app allows students to filter out colleges by location, deadline, application fee, if there is any essay requirement, standardized test policy and if they need a letter of recommendation.
