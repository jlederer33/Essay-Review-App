**Functionality:**
-
The functionality implemented in this was adding and removing colleges to a dashboard, and uploading and deleting essays for each college.
The current limitations are that you can only add one personal essay and one supplement essay to each college. 
In the future, we will try to make it so that students can add as many personal or supplement essays to the colleges. 
Moreover, the current iteration covers only the applicant dashboard. While the navigation will be the same, reviewer dashboard
will look a little different.


**Instructions:**
- 
Currently, there are 7 commands. They are:
1. Add College
2. Remove College
3. Upload Essay
4. Delete Essay 
5. View Dashboard
6. View essay 
7. Exit app

In order to execute each command, type in the corresponding integer. From there, the user will be prompted to enter the specific information depending on the command. 
Command 7, Exit app, will quit the program. Otherwise, the program will continue to loop, even in the event of an improper input.
