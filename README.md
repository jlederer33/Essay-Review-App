# ESSAY REVIEW APP:

**Functionality:**
- 
In order to meet this deadline, we had to cut out a lot of functionality from our original idea. Moreover, we were not able to add all the functionality we wanted for this phase. Currently, users are
able to create essays in the user essays page and view the full text of the essay. Moreover, users are able to delete the essay from the recyclerview. Moreover, the user is able to submit their essay to 
the all essays screen, which represents essays from all users. From this screen, users are able to view Essays, as well as see how many reviews each essay has. Once each essay is clicked on, users are able to
create reviews, as well as delete them. 

While it would not be hard to implement, we were unable to add edit text during this phase. We (I) plan to add this functionality 
during the post 203 lifecycle of this app. Moreover, there is no way to differentiate between users yet. This functionality will also be added later
on. We (I, again) would like to add a college application screen, in order to help users better organize their essays. We also want to add a search function in
all essays, which would allow reviewers to find specific essays. While this would not be hard to implement, given how much code reorganization it would take we 
decided it would be best to leave it out for now.
